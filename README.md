### 📊 Clustering Techniques in Machine Learning

This project explores **unsupervised learning** techniques, specifically **clustering algorithms**, to discover patterns and group structures in unlabeled datasets. Clustering helps in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image compression, and more.

#### ✅ Algorithms Implemented:

* **K-Means Clustering**
* **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
* **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**

#### 🛠️ Key Features:

* Preprocessing pipeline for scaling and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
* Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn to compare clusters.
* Elbow method and Silhouette Score for optimal cluster selection.
* Real-world datasets for practical demonstration.

#### 📂 Dataset Examples:

* Iris dataset
* Mall customer segmentation
* Synthetic blobs and moons

#### 📎 Use Cases:

* Customer segmentation
* Market basket analysis
* Image compression
* Anomaly detection
